# 📊 Statistics for Data Science - Group Project

Welcome to our group project for the *Statistics for Data Science* course. This project explores a real-world dataset related to housing prices in Türkiye, with a focus on data cleaning, analysis, and hypothesis generation.

## 📁 Dataset Information

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Türkiye Home Price Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cabbar14ylnce/trkiye-home-price-data?select=home_price.csv)
- **Description**: This dataset contains detailed information on **over 20,000 homes** from various cities across Türkiye. It includes key features such as location, number of rooms, area, price, and more. You can find metadata and further descriptions on the dataset’s Kaggle page.

## ⁉️ Why This Dataset?

We chose this dataset because it is **rich in real-world data issues**:
- Contains **null/missing values**
- Has **categorical (string) data** that must be transformed into numerical form
- Requires **extensive cleaning** and processing before any meaningful analysis

This makes it a perfect candidate for practicing the full **data wrangling lifecycle**, just like we would in a real data science project.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to:
> **Clean and prepare the dataset** to make it highly effective and usable for downstream tasks.

This includes:
- Handling missing data
- Transforming categorical features
- Normalizing and analyzing variables
- Visualizing distributions
- Creating a dataset suitable for:
  - Feeding into a machine learning model
  - Generating hypotheses related to house pricing
  - Making data-driven suggestions for real estate pricing logic (e.g., filtering overpriced/underpriced listings)

We aim to simulate how data scientists deal with messy real-world data and make it valuable through thoughtful cleaning and preparation.
